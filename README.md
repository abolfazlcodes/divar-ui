# Introduction

This is a demo version of the Divar web application's main page.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
#or
npm i
```
Secondly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To run the test, you can use:
```bash
npm test
#or
npm run test:watch
#or
npm run test:coverage
#or
npm run test:coverage-watch
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can edit the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
